# MI-DPO-Iterator

This application is one of homeworks at CTU FIT in Prague for subject MI-DPO (Design patterns and OOP, Návrhové vzory a OOP).
I DID NOT write this code. Application was given to us as broken and unfinished. The homework is to make it work and all "unit tests" must pass.

It is old fashioned (using ant builds), code format is bad, application structure is bad and it carries binary dependencies with it. I would prefer maven project standard.
